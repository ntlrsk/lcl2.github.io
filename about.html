      <h2>About</h2>
  
      <p class="lead">Learning Creative Learning is a course offered at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>. It introduces ideas and strategies for designing technologies to support creative learning. Last year, for the first time, <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a> and the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">Media Lab</a> offered the course online. And this year we are doing it again, but different.</p>
<p class="lead">Instead of thinking about this as a course, we are designing learning activities for a community. We will still have online seminars, course materials, and hands-on activities, and those are open to anyone with a computer and Internet access. But we are moving away from sign-ups and building more flexibility into how you can participate.</p>

      <h2>How is this going to work? What will I be learning and doing?</h2>

	<p class="lead">LCL2 will start on March 18 with six weeks of discussions and activities, followed by a few weeks to work on projects, leading to a creative-learning exhibition in May. There will be online sessions on Tuesdays from 1:00-2:00pm Boston time.</p>
	<p class="lead">LCL2 will focus on key aspects of the Media Lab approach to learning: Projects, Peers, Passion, and Play. We invite you to apply these ideas to your own teaching and learning experiences. Together, we can reimagine and reinvent education.</p>
    	<p class="lead">Each week we’ll focus on a particular topic related to creative learning, such as “Interest-Based Learning” or “Powerful Ideas” or “Tinkering.” We'll host a panel discussion, inviting some of the world’s best thinkers and builders. Different from last year, we will pre-record these conversations so that we can join the viewing and discuss with all of you as we are watching them together. We'll also design a hands-on activity for each week. You'll get a chance to experiment with lots of different technologies and  projects - many of which were developed in the <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu" target="_blank">Lifelong Kindergarten group</a> right here at the MIT Media Lab.</p>
              
      <h2>A big experiment. Tinkering together!</h2>

        <p class="lead">Last year we said the course was a BIG experiment. And the same is true again this year. We plan to continue to tinker with the course format and explore new tools for sharing ideas and supporting discussions. We hope you will continue to tinker with us. In the spirit of learning and technology, we hope that you will jump in as collaborators rather than passive recipients. Things might break, but we are committed to fixing them and we invite you to break and fix things with us.</p>

        <h2>Who are you people? Who created this course?</h2>

        <p class="lead">The on-campus version of Learning Creative Learning was first taught by Mitch Resnick, who is the director of Lifelong Kindergarten and the LEGO Papert Professor at the MIT Media Lab. He has been a pioneer in technology & learning for a looooooong time. And has built such wonderful things as <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=135">Programmable Bricks</a>, a collaboration with the LEGO Company. More about Mitch is <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="lead">The online course is a real team effort. <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nrusk">Natalie Rusk</a>, a Research Scientist in the Lifelong Kindergarten group who founded the <a href="http://www.computerclubhouse.org/">Computer Clubhouse</a>, has been instrumenal in overall course design, and <a href="http://1l2p.net">Philipp Schmidt</a>, cofounder of <a href="http://info.p2pu.org">P2PU</a> and a Director's Fellow at the Media Lab, experiments with new ways for people to learn online. The other team members are <a href="https://twitter.com/kamcconachie">Katherine McConachie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlishaPanjwani">Alisha Panjwani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/grifpeterson">Grif Peterson</a>, and <a href="http://www.srishtisethi.com/">Srishti Sethi</a>.
       
              <h2>This year we built an amazing new platform</h2>

              <p class="lead">Actually, we didn't! Like last year, our platform is still the web and we like things distributed and open. We also wanted to create a model that is easy to replicate for anyone. We use off-the-shelf tools, like Google Hangouts and open source software like the Mechanical MOOC (<a href="https://github.com/p2pu/mechanicalmooc">github</a>) and <a href="http://discourse.org" target="_blank">Discourse</a>. It's not that hard to build a course like this yourself!</p>
