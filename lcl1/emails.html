	<p class="lead">Below are the emails we send out to all the registered groups.

Please consider joining the G+ community (link above) where you can find others to discuss your ideas and work.</p>

<h3>Feb 26 - Week 4</h3>
<br>
<b>Hey Friends! How are you, all this week?</b><br>
<br>It's just a little email today. A tiny little email, about BIG ideas.&nbsp;
<br><br>
<b>Let's enjoy ourselves!&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<span><br>All these readings, and activities, and sessions might feel a little overwhelming sometimes. But don't be overwhelmed. And certainly don't feel like you are falling behind. Rather&nbsp;feel free to pick and choose, work on things that catch your interest, and skip others. Check out the big G+ community if your group is a little slow, or focus on your cohort if the community is too noisy. <b><i>This is </i></b><b><i>your course.</i></b> You can make it work however you want (and we'd love to hear how it's going or if we can help&nbsp;- tweet a link to @medialabcourse and we'll share).</span>
<br><br>
<b>Live Panel 4 &gt; BIG Ideas - Mar 4, 10am EST</b>
<br><br>
Next week's panel will feature two speakers with ideas about big ideas. Mitch will host Alan Kay and Brian Silverman. Some of their readings are listed in the syllabus, for example&nbsp;"<b><i>Powerful Ideas Need Love Too!</i></b>" (not your typical academic article title, isn't it?). Sign-up for the Google event to get automatic reminders. And like last week, feel free to submit questions for Mitch, Alan and Brian. Thanks for the great questions for Dale and Leah last week!&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Automatic reminders - <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/c6014secupa8vsngo38bv3r4ll8">Sign-up for the Event&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>Questions for the panel? - <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106132864609383396284/stream/a1b0eb9d-883e-4408-8b5b-ad388a095904">Submit them here</a></li>
<li><span>Readings - <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="syllabus.html">Link to the syllabus</a></span></li>
</ul>
<b>Reflection &gt; What's your big idea?</b>
<br><br>
Can you think of an example for a powerful idea from your own experience? What people, materials, or environments supported your learning? How might you help others understand and appreciate this powerful idea? To get you started, think of the way <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/Papert-Big-Idea.pdf">Papert described a big idea</a> as&nbsp;general (applicable across domains), intelligible (easy to grasp), and personal (rooted in experience).&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Share it with your small group, or post it into the G+ community</li>
</ul>
<b>Activity &gt; Turtle Art</b>
<br><br>
<span>Create a project with<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/software/turtleart/">&nbsp;TurtleArt</a>, and reflect on any “powerful ideas” you engaged with in the process. (For more background, see<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/TurtleArt.pdf">&nbsp;TurtleArt paper</a>&nbsp;below.)</span>
<br>
<br>And finally, another reminder to relax and enjoy! No need to "keep up"! Just connect &amp; collaborate, be inspired &amp;&nbsp;inspire others - and do it in a way that makes sense for you. There are a million different ways to learn creatively!<br><br>
Cheerio!
<br><br>

<h3>Feb 13 - Week 2</h3>
<br>
<b>Learners! Creative Learners!</b>
<br><br>
Week 2 is full of interest-based learning goodies: a great panel, some iconic readings, and an activity that takes you back to your childhood. It doesn't get much better than this.<br>
<br>Before we get started - If these group emails get too much, or life gets in the way, click the <b>unsubscribe link</b> at the very bottom of this email (or any future emails from us) and the learning will stop. Ok, actually only the emails will stop. Because you are still free to participate in the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106132864609383396284">G+ community</a>, work through the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> or watch the<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106132864609383396284/events"> session videos</a>
<br>
<b><br>Block The Date - Session 2 - Tue, Feb 19</b>
<br>
<br>Next week we will meet on Tuesday(instead of Monday) - February 19 at 10:15 AM (US Eastern). <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/joi">Joi Ito</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.itofisher.com/mito/">Mimi Ito</a> will be joining us as guest panelists and talk about their own learning trajectories and how their interests led them to where they are today. It will be awesome. Maybe the back channel chat will even work (we're using a different tool). The best way to keep track of the event and receive updates is to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/cmfn189m3hrnc1t4sra32a6nu7o">register here</a>. And if you have burning questions that you would like the panel to discuss, please submit them <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=2028f2">here</a>
<br>
<b><br>Task 1 - Readings &amp; Discussion</b>
<br>
<br>In preparation for the Feb 19 panel, please check out the suggested readings (all links are below) and write a short (2-3 paragraphs, no more!) reflection. Share it within the group, read some of the other posts and discuss. Here are some questions to get you started:<br>
<ul>
<li>What did you find most surprising in the readings?</li>
<li>What did you disagree with or have questions about?</li></ul><b>Task 2 -The Activity</b>
<br>
<br>For this week's activity, read Seymour Papert’s essay on the “<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/gears-v1.pdf">Gears of My Childhood</a>” and write about an object from your childhood that interested and influenced you. Share your story in the group. For inspiration, you can find examples from other students who took the class in the additional resources section below.
<br>
<b><br>Intro Video - Say "Hello World!"</b>
<br>
<br>We've already received loads of introduction videos, but if yours isn't one of them (yet) it's not too late. Just upload a 30 sec video to youtube or vimeo and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HoGe56ikbFHeRQUITqF-UPRQzHuloTZLWx2yoh0FFXo/viewform">submit the URL in this form</a> - introduce yourself, tell us where you are, and why you are excited to participate in the course. We will collect all the videos into a single gallery. It will be beautiful.
<br>
